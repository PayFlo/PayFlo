Hello there 👋

- 🏢 I’m an IT Systems Engineer @ PayFit
- 👾 I'm a nerd/geek, and I'm interested in everything related to technology. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bash, I'm quite the noobie so bear with me (Python next if everythong goes well).
- 🎮 As a proper nerd, on my free time I'm a gamer and a tabletop player.
